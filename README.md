# Fashion Store Inventory & Sales Management API

A complete **FastAPI backend portfolio project** for managing fashion store inventory, sales, customers, orders, payments, invoices, reports, AI Assistant, and Predictive Analytics.

This project is designed as a production-style backend system for a fashion retail business. It demonstrates real-world backend development, database design, authentication, business workflow implementation, automated testing, AI integration, and analytics-based decision support.

---

## Project Overview

Fashion retail stores need a system to manage products, stock, customers, sales, payments, invoices, and business decisions. This project solves that problem with a complete backend API and frontend dashboard.

The system allows store admins and staff to:

- Manage products, categories, variants, and stock
- Track customers and order history
- Create orders and receive payments
- Generate invoices
- View sales and profit reports
- Ask business questions through an AI Assistant
- Use Predictive Analytics for forecasting, stock risk, restock planning, customer insights, and product recommendations

This is not only a CRUD project. It includes authentication, role-based access, business logic, AI Assistant, predictive analytics, frontend integration, demo data, documentation, and automated tests.

How much profit did we make?
Which products should I restock?
Forecast next 7 days sales
Show customer insights
Recommend products for customer 1
```

### AI Assistant Design

The AI system uses a hybrid approach:

```text
User Question
     ↓
Intent Detection
     ↓
Safe Business Logic / SQLAlchemy Query
     ↓
Analytics Engine if needed
     ↓
Structured Response for Dashboard
```

The AI Assistant is designed to avoid unsafe direct SQL generation. It uses controlled backend logic and safe SQLAlchemy queries.

## Predictive Analytics and ML-Style Intelligence

This project includes a Predictive Analytics module for business decision support.

The analytics system helps the store owner understand future sales, stock risk, customer behavior, and product demand.

### Analytics Modules

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| Analytics Overview | Summary of business intelligence metrics |
| Sales Forecast | Predicts upcoming sales using recent sales trends |
| Stock Risk Prediction | Finds products that may run out soon |
| Restock Plan | Suggests which products should be purchased again |
| Customer Insights | Segments customers based on purchase behavior |
| Product Recommendations | Recommends products using sales and customer history |

### Sales Forecast

The sales forecast module estimates future sales using recent order and payment patterns.

It helps answer:

```text
How much sales can we expect in the next 7 days?
What is the recent sales trend?
How is the business performing?
```

### Stock Risk Prediction

The stock risk module identifies products that may become low stock or out of stock.

It helps answer:

```text
Which products are risky?
Which products may run out soon?
Which items need attention?
```

### Restock Plan

The restock plan recommends which products should be purchased again.

It considers:

- Current stock
- Recent sales demand
- Lead time
- Safety stock
- Estimated buying requirement

### Customer Insights

The customer insights module analyzes customers based on:

- Total spending
- Purchase count
- Last purchase date
- Customer activity

It helps identify:

- VIP customers
- Regular customers
- New customers
- Inactive customers

### Product Recommendations

- Product popularity
- Available stock
- Customer purchase history
- Category preference

It supports both:

- General product recommendations
- Customer-based product recommendations
